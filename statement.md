# Welcome!

This Python template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```python runnable
print('Hello World!')
```

# Advanced usage

Trying to add another executable env :
``` python runnable
a = 2*3
b = a -3
print(b)
```


If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced Python template](https://tech.io/select-repo/429)
